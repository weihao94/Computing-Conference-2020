## About the Conference

Computing Conference (formerly called Science and Information (SAI) Conference) is a research conference held in London, UK since 2013. The conference series has featured keynote talks, special sessions, poster presentation, tutorials, workshops, and contributed papers each year.

Despite the short history of computer science as a formal academic discipline, it has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and societyâ€”in fact, along with electronics, it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the Information Age and a driver of the Information Revolution

The goal of the conference is to be a premier venue for researchers and industry practitioners to share new ideas, research results and development experiences in various fields. It is one of the best respected conferences in the area of computer science.
